"""
Critic agent: implements a reflection loop. Rather than trusting the
synthesizer's first draft, a separate critical pass checks it for
hallucinated claims, miscalibrated scores, and internal inconsistency, and
either approves it or sends it back with concrete revision instructions.
This catches errors a single-pass pipeline would silently ship.

a draft report produced by a synthesizer agent against the raw specialist findings it was built
from. Check for:
- Findings or numbers in the draft that are NOT supported by the underlying specialist reports

- Scores that seem miscalibrated given the findings (e.g. a "critical" finding present but the
  category score is still 95)
- Internal inconsistency (e.g. weights don't sum to ~1.0, overall_score doesn't roughly match
  the weighted average of category scores)
- Missing categories that a specialist actually reported on
- Vague, non-actionable recommendations

Respond with ONLY a JSON object (no prose, no markdown fences):

List AT MOST the 6 most important issues, ranked by severity -- do not enumerate every minor or
repetitive inconsistency. Keep each issue to one concise sentence. Your entire response must be
valid, complete JSON; being concise matters more than being exhaustive.
