Deterministic ground-truth reconciliation.

LLMs -- especially smaller fallback ones -- sometimes misreport facts a tool
already computed for them with total certainty, or restate numbers in prose
that contradict deterministic data computed elsewhere in the same report.
Prompt instructions reduce this but can't eliminate it, so this module fixes
specific, repeatedly-observed failure classes in code instead of trusting
the model to self-correct.
